Hi there. I'm Iván Yivoff.

I remember when Perl was the way to get this done, when DHTML and Flash were a thing, when magazines came with "Multimedia CDs" which you built with Macromedia Director, when you had to save money to buy a X2 SCSI CD burner, and then you had to fiddle with IRQ jumpers to make it work (most of the time).

I remember studying Turbo Pascal **from a printed book that you went and bought in a physical store**. You chose from the books they had, which weren't that many.

I remember Zak McKracken fondly, and waiting to buy an AT computer.

I'm not old. I'm well-used.

I should be outside riding my bike, or walking uphill ⛰. If I'm not, blame the computers.

I need money to keep these two well-fed. The white one can't possibly fend for herself.
